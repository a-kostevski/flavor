This simple mechanism transforms how we navigate and discover knowledge.\nWhy Backlinks Matter Traditional links are one-way streets. You know where you\u0026rsquo;re going, but you can\u0026rsquo;t see where you came from. Backlinks complete the picture.\nConsider a note about \u0026ldquo;Machine Learning\u0026rdquo;. Without backlinks, you only see what ML links to. With backlinks, you discover:\nProjects that use ML Problems ML might solve Related concepts you\u0026rsquo;ve explored This serendipitous discovery is impossible with one-way links.\nEnabling Discovery Backlinks surface unexpected connections. When you create a note about a new concept and see it already has backlinks, you\u0026rsquo;ve discovered relationships you didn\u0026rsquo;t consciously make.\nThis is the essence of networked thought: the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts.\nImplementation In this system, backlinks appear automatically at the bottom of each note.

It turns the abstract idea of \u0026ldquo;linked thinking\u0026rdquo; into something you can see and explore.\nWhy Visualize? Our brains are visual. A list of backlinks tells you what connects, but a graph shows you how the connections form patterns.\nTry It Open the full-page graph to explore. Drag nodes, filter by section, toggle link types. How It Works The graph uses D3.js force simulation. Each note becomes a node; each link becomes an edge.\nconst simulation = d3.forceSimulation(nodes) .force(\u0026#39;link\u0026#39;, d3.forceLink(links).id(d =\u0026gt; d.id)) .force(\u0026#39;charge\u0026#39;, d3.forceManyBody().strength(-200)) .force(\u0026#39;center\u0026#39;, d3.forceCenter(width / 2, height / 2)); Nodes repel each other (charge force) while links pull connected nodes together. The result is a layout where clusters naturally emerge.\nTwo Types of Edges The graph shows two kinds of connections:\nDirect links (solid blue): Explicit wikilinks between notes. These are intentional connections you create.\nTag connections (dashed gray): Notes sharing the same tag. These are implicit - they suggest possible relationships you might not have noticed.\nTechnical Detail: Edge Detection Direct links are detected by scanning note content for [[...]] patterns and wikilink shortcodes. This happens at build time, so the graph data is static and fast to load.\n{{- $bracketMatches := findRE `\\[\\[([^\\]|]+)` $content -}} Reading the Graph Clusters indicate related concepts. The [[Note-Taking]] and [[Learning]] nodes should be close together, connected by shared notes.\nHubs are highly-connected nodes. MOCs like [[Note-Taking]] naturally become hubs because they link to many notes.\nBridges connect different clusters. A note that links learning concepts to technical implementations bridges those domains.\nFiltering The full-page graph offers controls to:\nShow/hide sections (articles, notes, projects) Toggle direct links vs tag connections Search for specific notes Zoom in on details This makes large graphs manageable while preserving the overall structure.\nLimitations The graph is a model, not reality.

Modern digital tools make the method even more powerful. ) Why Zettelkasten? Most note-taking systems fail because they\u0026rsquo;re designed for storage, not thinking.

This simple mechanism transforms how we navigate and discover knowledge.\nWhy Backlinks Matter Traditional links are one-way streets. You know where you\u0026rsquo;re going, but you can\u0026rsquo;t see where you came from. Backlinks complete the picture.\nConsider a note about \u0026ldquo;Machine Learning\u0026rdquo;. Without backlinks, you only see what ML links to. With backlinks, you discover:\nProjects that use ML Problems ML might solve Related concepts you\u0026rsquo;ve explored This serendipitous discovery is impossible with one-way links.\nEnabling Discovery Backlinks surface unexpected connections.

A list of backlinks tells you what connects, but a graph shows you how the connections form patterns.\nTry It Open the full-page graph to explore. Drag nodes, filter by section, toggle link types. How It Works The graph uses D3.js force simulation. Each note becomes a node; each link becomes an edge.\nconst simulation = d3.forceSimulation(nodes) .force(\u0026#39;link\u0026#39;, d3.forceLink(links).id(d =\u0026gt; d.id)) .force(\u0026#39;charge\u0026#39;, d3.forceManyBody().strength(-200)) .force(\u0026#39;center\u0026#39;, d3.forceCenter(width / 2, height / 2)); Nodes repel each other (charge force) while links pull connected nodes together. The result is a layout where clusters naturally emerge.\nTwo Types of Edges The graph shows two kinds of connections:\nDirect links (solid blue): Explicit wikilinks between notes. These are intentional connections you create.\nTag connections (dashed gray): Notes sharing the same tag. These are implicit - they suggest possible relationships you might not have noticed.\nTechnical Detail: Edge Detection Direct links are detected by scanning note content for [[...]] patterns and wikilink shortcodes. This happens at build time, so the graph data is static and fast to load.\n{{- $bracketMatches := findRE `\\[\\[([^\\]|]+)` $content -}} Reading the Graph Clusters indicate related concepts. The [[Note-Taking]] and [[Learning]] nodes should be close together, connected by shared notes.\nHubs are highly-connected nodes. MOCs like [[Note-Taking]] naturally become hubs because they link to many notes.\nBridges connect different clusters. A note that links learning concepts to technical implementations bridges those domains.\nFiltering The full-page graph offers controls to:\nShow/hide sections (articles, notes, projects) Toggle direct links vs tag connections Search for specific notes Zoom in on details This makes large graphs manageable while preserving the overall structure.\nLimitations The graph is a model, not reality.

Developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann, who used it to write over 70 books, the system creates a network of interconnected ideas. 01 (sidenote: 01 Luhmann maintained his Zettelkasten on paper index cards. Modern digital tools make the method even more powerful. ) Why Zettelkasten? Most note-taking systems fail because they\u0026rsquo;re designed for storage, not thinking. You capture information, file it away, and never see it again.\nThe Zettelkasten is different. It\u0026rsquo;s designed for:\nConnection: Every note links to others Emergence: Ideas combine in unexpected ways Growth: The system becomes more valuable over time Start Small You don\u0026rsquo;t need thousands of notes to benefit. Even 20-30 well-connected notes create useful emergence. Core Principles 1. Atomic Notes Each note should contain exactly one idea. See [[The Atomic Notes Principle]] for why this constraint is liberating, not limiting.\n2. Write for Your Future Self Don\u0026rsquo;t just copy quotes. Write in your own words, as if explaining to someone unfamiliar with the source. This forces understanding.\n3. Link Liberally Every note should link to at least one other note. These connections are where the magic happens. See [[Bidirectional Linking]] for how backlinks enable discovery.\nGetting Started Pick a tool: This site uses Hugo with wikilinks. Obsidian, Roam, and others work too. Start with what interests you: Don\u0026rsquo;t try to build a comprehensive system. Follow curiosity. Create your first MOC: A [[Note-Taking|Map of Content]] organizes related notes. Review regularly: [[Spaced Repetition]] keeps knowledge fresh. No Perfect System The best system is one you\u0026rsquo;ll actually use. Don\u0026rsquo;t over-engineer. Start writing, and evolve your approach over time. Common Mistakes Over-categorizing: Tags and folders are less important than links. 04 (sidenote: 04 Luhmann famously said his Zettelkasten was his \u0026ldquo;second brain\u0026rdquo; - not a filing cabinet. ) Collecting without processing: Capture is easy; thinking is hard.

It turns the abstract idea of \u0026ldquo;linked thinking\u0026rdquo; into something you can see and explore.\nWhy Visualize? Our brains are visual. A list of backlinks tells you what connects, but a graph shows you how the connections form patterns.\nTry It Open the full-page graph to explore. Drag nodes, filter by section, toggle link types. How It Works The graph uses D3.js force simulation. Each note becomes a node; each link becomes an edge.\nconst simulation = d3.forceSimulation(nodes) .force(\u0026#39;link\u0026#39;, d3.forceLink(links).id(d =\u0026gt; d.id)) .force(\u0026#39;charge\u0026#39;, d3.forceManyBody().strength(-200)) .force(\u0026#39;center\u0026#39;, d3.forceCenter(width / 2, height / 2)); Nodes repel each other (charge force) while links pull connected nodes together. The result is a layout where clusters naturally emerge.\nTwo Types of Edges The graph shows two kinds of connections:\nDirect links (solid blue): Explicit wikilinks between notes. These are intentional connections you create.\nTag connections (dashed gray): Notes sharing the same tag. These are implicit - they suggest possible relationships you might not have noticed.\nTechnical Detail: Edge Detection Direct links are detected by scanning note content for [[...]] patterns and wikilink shortcodes. This happens at build time, so the graph data is static and fast to load.\n{{- $bracketMatches := findRE `\\[\\[([^\\]|]+)` $content -}} Reading the Graph Clusters indicate related concepts. The [[Note-Taking]] and [[Learning]] nodes should be close together, connected by shared notes.\nHubs are highly-connected nodes. MOCs like [[Note-Taking]] naturally become hubs because they link to many notes.\nBridges connect different clusters. A note that links learning concepts to technical implementations bridges those domains.\nFiltering The full-page graph offers controls to:\nShow/hide sections (articles, notes, projects) Toggle direct links vs tag connections Search for specific notes Zoom in on details This makes large graphs manageable while preserving the overall structure.\nLimitations The graph is a model, not reality. It shows explicit connections but not the implicit understanding in your head.\nUse it as a tool for discovery, not a measure of knowledge completeness.\nBuilding Your Own The graph is generated entirely in Hugo templates.

Developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann, who used it to write over 70 books, the system creates a network of interconnected ideas. 01 (sidenote: 01 Luhmann maintained his Zettelkasten on paper index cards. Modern digital tools make the method even more powerful. ) Why Zettelkasten? Most note-taking systems fail because they\u0026rsquo;re designed for storage, not thinking. You capture information, file it away, and never see it again.\nThe Zettelkasten is different. It\u0026rsquo;s designed for:\nConnection: Every note links to others Emergence: Ideas combine in unexpected ways Growth: The system becomes more valuable over time Start Small You don\u0026rsquo;t need thousands of notes to benefit. Even 20-30 well-connected notes create useful emergence. Core Principles 1. Atomic Notes Each note should contain exactly one idea. See [[The Atomic Notes Principle]] for why this constraint is liberating, not limiting.\n2. Write for Your Future Self Don\u0026rsquo;t just copy quotes. Write in your own words, as if explaining to someone unfamiliar with the source. This forces understanding.\n3. Link Liberally Every note should link to at least one other note. These connections are where the magic happens. See [[Bidirectional Linking]] for how backlinks enable discovery.\nGetting Started Pick a tool: This site uses Hugo with wikilinks. Obsidian, Roam, and others work too. Start with what interests you: Don\u0026rsquo;t try to build a comprehensive system. Follow curiosity. Create your first MOC: A [[Note-Taking|Map of Content]] organizes related notes. Review regularly: [[Spaced Repetition]] keeps knowledge fresh. No Perfect System The best system is one you\u0026rsquo;ll actually use. Don\u0026rsquo;t over-engineer. Start writing, and evolve your approach over time. Common Mistakes Over-categorizing: Tags and folders are less important than links. 04 (sidenote: 04 Luhmann famously said his Zettelkasten was his \u0026ldquo;second brain\u0026rdquo; - not a filing cabinet. ) Collecting without processing: Capture is easy; thinking is hard. See [[Progressive Summarization]] for a method to process notes over time.\nExpecting immediate results: The value compounds.

When you create a note about a new concept and see it already has backlinks, you\u0026rsquo;ve discovered relationships you didn\u0026rsquo;t consciously make.\nThis is the essence of networked thought: the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts.\nImplementation In this system, backlinks appear automatically at the bottom of each note. They show:\nThe linking note\u0026rsquo;s title Context around the link A direct path to explore further Foundation for Graphs Bidirectional links enable the [[Note-Taking|knowledge graph visualization]]. Each bidirectional link becomes an edge in the graph, making your knowledge structure visible and navigable.\nSee also:\n[[The Atomic Notes Principle]] - Makes links precise [[Evergreen Notes]] - Accumulates links over time ","date":"2024-12-03","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/bidirectional-linking/","section":"notes","tags":["zettelkasten","note-taking","knowledge-management"],"title":"Bidirectional Linking"},{"categories":["technical"],"contents":"The knowledge graph visualizes connections between notes. It turns the abstract idea of \u0026ldquo;linked thinking\u0026rdquo; into something you can see and explore.\nWhy Visualize? Our brains are visual. A list of backlinks tells you what connects, but a graph shows you how the connections form patterns.\nTry It Open the full-page graph to explore. Drag nodes, filter by section, toggle link types. How It Works The graph uses D3.js force simulation. Each note becomes a node; each link becomes an edge.\nconst simulation = d3.forceSimulation(nodes) .force(\u0026#39;link\u0026#39;, d3.forceLink(links).id(d =\u0026gt; d.id)) .force(\u0026#39;charge\u0026#39;, d3.forceManyBody().strength(-200)) .force(\u0026#39;center\u0026#39;, d3.forceCenter(width / 2, height / 2)); Nodes repel each other (charge force) while links pull connected nodes together. The result is a layout where clusters naturally emerge.\nTwo Types of Edges The graph shows two kinds of connections:\nDirect links (solid blue): Explicit wikilinks between notes. These are intentional connections you create.\nTag connections (dashed gray): Notes sharing the same tag. These are implicit - they suggest possible relationships you might not have noticed.\nTechnical Detail: Edge Detection Direct links are detected by scanning note content for [[...]] patterns and wikilink shortcodes. This happens at build time, so the graph data is static and fast to load.\n{{- $bracketMatches := findRE `\\[\\[([^\\]|]+)` $content -}} Reading the Graph Clusters indicate related concepts. The [[Note-Taking]] and [[Learning]] nodes should be close together, connected by shared notes.\nHubs are highly-connected nodes. MOCs like [[Note-Taking]] naturally become hubs because they link to many notes.\nBridges connect different clusters. A note that links learning concepts to technical implementations bridges those domains.\nFiltering The full-page graph offers controls to:\nShow/hide sections (articles, notes, projects) Toggle direct links vs tag connections Search for specific notes Zoom in on details This makes large graphs manageable while preserving the overall structure.\nLimitations The graph is a model, not reality. It shows explicit connections but not the implicit understanding in your head.\nUse it as a tool for discovery, not a measure of knowledge completeness.\nBuilding Your Own The graph is generated entirely in Hugo templates. No external build step required. Check the theme\u0026rsquo;s partials/graph.html for implementation details.\nSee [[Bidirectional Linking]] for why the connections matter more than the visualization itself.\n","date":"2024-12-03","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/articles/building-a-knowledge-graph/","section":"articles","tags":["hugo","javascript","visualization"],"title":"Building a Knowledge Graph"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Evergreen notes are notes designed to grow and improve over time.

Developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann, who used it to write over 70 books, the system creates a network of interconnected ideas. 01 (sidenote: 01 Luhmann maintained his Zettelkasten on paper index cards. Modern digital tools make the method even more powerful. ) Why Zettelkasten? Most note-taking systems fail because they\u0026rsquo;re designed for storage, not thinking. You capture information, file it away, and never see it again.\nThe Zettelkasten is different. It\u0026rsquo;s designed for:\nConnection: Every note links to others Emergence: Ideas combine in unexpected ways Growth: The system becomes more valuable over time Start Small You don\u0026rsquo;t need thousands of notes to benefit. Even 20-30 well-connected notes create useful emergence. Core Principles 1. Atomic Notes Each note should contain exactly one idea. See [[The Atomic Notes Principle]] for why this constraint is liberating, not limiting.\n2. Write for Your Future Self Don\u0026rsquo;t just copy quotes. Write in your own words, as if explaining to someone unfamiliar with the source. This forces understanding.\n3. Link Liberally Every note should link to at least one other note. These connections are where the magic happens. See [[Bidirectional Linking]] for how backlinks enable discovery.\nGetting Started Pick a tool: This site uses Hugo with wikilinks. Obsidian, Roam, and others work too. Start with what interests you: Don\u0026rsquo;t try to build a comprehensive system. Follow curiosity. Create your first MOC: A [[Note-Taking|Map of Content]] organizes related notes. Review regularly: [[Spaced Repetition]] keeps knowledge fresh. No Perfect System The best system is one you\u0026rsquo;ll actually use. Don\u0026rsquo;t over-engineer. Start writing, and evolve your approach over time. Common Mistakes Over-categorizing: Tags and folders are less important than links. 04 (sidenote: 04 Luhmann famously said his Zettelkasten was his \u0026ldquo;second brain\u0026rdquo; - not a filing cabinet. ) Collecting without processing: Capture is easy; thinking is hard. See [[Progressive Summarization]] for a method to process notes over time.\nExpecting immediate results: The value compounds.

Instead of processing everything upfront, you distill notes progressively as you use them.\nThe Layers Each pass adds a layer of highlighting:\nLayer 0: Original content (capture) Layer 1: Bold the most interesting passages Layer 2: Highlight the bolded passages that stand out Layer 3: Write a brief summary at the top Layer 4: Remix into your own original content\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t apply all layers immediately. Each layer is added when you revisit the note for a specific purpose.\nJust-in-Time Processing The key insight: don\u0026rsquo;t process notes until you need them. Most captured content is never used. Progressive summarization ensures you only invest effort in notes that prove valuable.\nThis connects to [[Spaced Repetition]]: each revisit is an opportunity for both review and distillation.\nRelationship to Zettelkasten Progressive summarization is compatible with the [[The Atomic Notes Principle|atomic notes principle]]. As you distill a note to its essence, you might extract multiple atomic notes from the highlights.\nIt bridges the gap between quick capture and [[Evergreen Notes]]:\nCapture quickly (fleeting notes) Progressively distill over time Extract permanent atomic notes when insights crystallize Practical Application Start with Layer 1 on everything you capture.

Each review strengthens the memory and slows the decay rate. By timing reviews just before you\u0026rsquo;d forget, you maximize retention with minimum effort.\nThe optimal intervals follow a pattern:\nFirst review: 1 day Second review: 3 days Third review: 7 days Fourth review: 14 days And so on, roughly doubling each time Application to Note-Taking Spaced repetition complements [[Evergreen Notes]] naturally. Each time you revisit a note to add links or refine content, you\u0026rsquo;re reinforcing that knowledge.\nThe [[Note-Taking|knowledge graph]] can guide your reviews. Notes with many connections are naturally reviewed more often as you traverse the graph. Orphan notes might need deliberate scheduling.\nTools and Systems Dedicated SRS tools like Anki automate interval scheduling. But even without special software, the principle applies:\nRevisit notes periodically Use daily notes to reference older concepts Let curiosity guide exploratory sessions Connection to Writing Writing itself is a form of retrieval practice.

This simple mechanism transforms how we navigate and discover knowledge.\nWhy Backlinks Matter Traditional links are one-way streets. You know where you\u0026rsquo;re going, but you can\u0026rsquo;t see where you came from. Backlinks complete the picture.\nConsider a note about \u0026ldquo;Machine Learning\u0026rdquo;. Without backlinks, you only see what ML links to. With backlinks, you discover:\nProjects that use ML Problems ML might solve Related concepts you\u0026rsquo;ve explored This serendipitous discovery is impossible with one-way links.\nEnabling Discovery Backlinks surface unexpected connections. When you create a note about a new concept and see it already has backlinks, you\u0026rsquo;ve discovered relationships you didn\u0026rsquo;t consciously make.\nThis is the essence of networked thought: the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts.\nImplementation In this system, backlinks appear automatically at the bottom of each note. They show:\nThe linking note\u0026rsquo;s title Context around the link A direct path to explore further Foundation for Graphs Bidirectional links enable the [[Note-Taking|knowledge graph visualization]]. Each bidirectional link becomes an edge in the graph, making your knowledge structure visible and navigable.\nSee also:\n[[The Atomic Notes Principle]] - Makes links precise [[Evergreen Notes]] - Accumulates links over time ","date":"2024-12-03","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/bidirectional-linking/","section":"notes","tags":["zettelkasten","note-taking","knowledge-management"],"title":"Bidirectional Linking"},{"categories":["technical"],"contents":"The knowledge graph visualizes connections between notes. It turns the abstract idea of \u0026ldquo;linked thinking\u0026rdquo; into something you can see and explore.\nWhy Visualize? Our brains are visual. A list of backlinks tells you what connects, but a graph shows you how the connections form patterns.\nTry It Open the full-page graph to explore. Drag nodes, filter by section, toggle link types. How It Works The graph uses D3.js force simulation. Each note becomes a node; each link becomes an edge.\nconst simulation = d3.forceSimulation(nodes) .force(\u0026#39;link\u0026#39;, d3.forceLink(links).id(d =\u0026gt; d.id)) .force(\u0026#39;charge\u0026#39;, d3.forceManyBody().strength(-200)) .force(\u0026#39;center\u0026#39;, d3.forceCenter(width / 2, height / 2)); Nodes repel each other (charge force) while links pull connected nodes together. The result is a layout where clusters naturally emerge.\nTwo Types of Edges The graph shows two kinds of connections:\nDirect links (solid blue): Explicit wikilinks between notes. These are intentional connections you create.\nTag connections (dashed gray): Notes sharing the same tag. These are implicit - they suggest possible relationships you might not have noticed.\nTechnical Detail: Edge Detection Direct links are detected by scanning note content for [[...]] patterns and wikilink shortcodes. This happens at build time, so the graph data is static and fast to load.\n{{- $bracketMatches := findRE `\\[\\[([^\\]|]+)` $content -}} Reading the Graph Clusters indicate related concepts. The [[Note-Taking]] and [[Learning]] nodes should be close together, connected by shared notes.\nHubs are highly-connected nodes. MOCs like [[Note-Taking]] naturally become hubs because they link to many notes.\nBridges connect different clusters. A note that links learning concepts to technical implementations bridges those domains.\nFiltering The full-page graph offers controls to:\nShow/hide sections (articles, notes, projects) Toggle direct links vs tag connections Search for specific notes Zoom in on details This makes large graphs manageable while preserving the overall structure.\nLimitations The graph is a model, not reality. It shows explicit connections but not the implicit understanding in your head.\nUse it as a tool for discovery, not a measure of knowledge completeness.\nBuilding Your Own The graph is generated entirely in Hugo templates.

Developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann, who used it to write over 70 books, the system creates a network of interconnected ideas. 01 (sidenote: 01 Luhmann maintained his Zettelkasten on paper index cards. Modern digital tools make the method even more powerful. ) Why Zettelkasten? Most note-taking systems fail because they\u0026rsquo;re designed for storage, not thinking. You capture information, file it away, and never see it again.\nThe Zettelkasten is different. It\u0026rsquo;s designed for:\nConnection: Every note links to others Emergence: Ideas combine in unexpected ways Growth: The system becomes more valuable over time Start Small You don\u0026rsquo;t need thousands of notes to benefit. Even 20-30 well-connected notes create useful emergence. Core Principles 1. Atomic Notes Each note should contain exactly one idea. See [[The Atomic Notes Principle]] for why this constraint is liberating, not limiting.\n2. Write for Your Future Self Don\u0026rsquo;t just copy quotes. Write in your own words, as if explaining to someone unfamiliar with the source. This forces understanding.\n3. Link Liberally Every note should link to at least one other note. These connections are where the magic happens. See [[Bidirectional Linking]] for how backlinks enable discovery.\nGetting Started Pick a tool: This site uses Hugo with wikilinks. Obsidian, Roam, and others work too. Start with what interests you: Don\u0026rsquo;t try to build a comprehensive system. Follow curiosity. Create your first MOC: A [[Note-Taking|Map of Content]] organizes related notes. Review regularly: [[Spaced Repetition]] keeps knowledge fresh. No Perfect System The best system is one you\u0026rsquo;ll actually use. Don\u0026rsquo;t over-engineer. Start writing, and evolve your approach over time. Common Mistakes Over-categorizing: Tags and folders are less important than links. 04 (sidenote: 04 Luhmann famously said his Zettelkasten was his \u0026ldquo;second brain\u0026rdquo; - not a filing cabinet. ) Collecting without processing: Capture is easy; thinking is hard.

Instead of processing everything upfront, you distill notes progressively as you use them.\nThe Layers Each pass adds a layer of highlighting:\nLayer 0: Original content (capture) Layer 1: Bold the most interesting passages Layer 2: Highlight the bolded passages that stand out Layer 3: Write a brief summary at the top Layer 4: Remix into your own original content\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t apply all layers immediately. Each layer is added when you revisit the note for a specific purpose.\nJust-in-Time Processing The key insight: don\u0026rsquo;t process notes until you need them. Most captured content is never used. Progressive summarization ensures you only invest effort in notes that prove valuable.\nThis connects to [[Spaced Repetition]]: each revisit is an opportunity for both review and distillation.\nRelationship to Zettelkasten Progressive summarization is compatible with the [[The Atomic Notes Principle|atomic notes principle]]. As you distill a note to its essence, you might extract multiple atomic notes from the highlights.\nIt bridges the gap between quick capture and [[Evergreen Notes]]:\nCapture quickly (fleeting notes) Progressively distill over time Extract permanent atomic notes when insights crystallize Practical Application Start with Layer 1 on everything you capture.

Each review strengthens the memory and slows the decay rate. By timing reviews just before you\u0026rsquo;d forget, you maximize retention with minimum effort.\nThe optimal intervals follow a pattern:\nFirst review: 1 day Second review: 3 days Third review: 7 days Fourth review: 14 days And so on, roughly doubling each time Application to Note-Taking Spaced repetition complements [[Evergreen Notes]] naturally. Each time you revisit a note to add links or refine content, you\u0026rsquo;re reinforcing that knowledge.\nThe [[Note-Taking|knowledge graph]] can guide your reviews. Notes with many connections are naturally reviewed more often as you traverse the graph. Orphan notes might need deliberate scheduling.\nTools and Systems Dedicated SRS tools like Anki automate interval scheduling. But even without special software, the principle applies:\nRevisit notes periodically Use daily notes to reference older concepts Let curiosity guide exploratory sessions Connection to Writing Writing itself is a form of retrieval practice.

This simple mechanism transforms how we navigate and discover knowledge.\nWhy Backlinks Matter Traditional links are one-way streets. You know where you\u0026rsquo;re going, but you can\u0026rsquo;t see where you came from. Backlinks complete the picture.\nConsider a note about \u0026ldquo;Machine Learning\u0026rdquo;. Without backlinks, you only see what ML links to. With backlinks, you discover:\nProjects that use ML Problems ML might solve Related concepts you\u0026rsquo;ve explored This serendipitous discovery is impossible with one-way links.\nEnabling Discovery Backlinks surface unexpected connections. When you create a note about a new concept and see it already has backlinks, you\u0026rsquo;ve discovered relationships you didn\u0026rsquo;t consciously make.\nThis is the essence of networked thought: the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts.\nImplementation In this system, backlinks appear automatically at the bottom of each note. They show:\nThe linking note\u0026rsquo;s title Context around the link A direct path to explore further Foundation for Graphs Bidirectional links enable the [[Note-Taking|knowledge graph visualization]]. Each bidirectional link becomes an edge in the graph, making your knowledge structure visible and navigable.\nSee also:\n[[The Atomic Notes Principle]] - Makes links precise [[Evergreen Notes]] - Accumulates links over time ","date":"2024-12-03","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/bidirectional-linking/","section":"notes","tags":["zettelkasten","note-taking","knowledge-management"],"title":"Bidirectional Linking"},{"categories":["technical"],"contents":"The knowledge graph visualizes connections between notes. It turns the abstract idea of \u0026ldquo;linked thinking\u0026rdquo; into something you can see and explore.\nWhy Visualize? Our brains are visual. A list of backlinks tells you what connects, but a graph shows you how the connections form patterns.\nTry It Open the full-page graph to explore. Drag nodes, filter by section, toggle link types. How It Works The graph uses D3.js force simulation. Each note becomes a node; each link becomes an edge.\nconst simulation = d3.forceSimulation(nodes) .force(\u0026#39;link\u0026#39;, d3.forceLink(links).id(d =\u0026gt; d.id)) .force(\u0026#39;charge\u0026#39;, d3.forceManyBody().strength(-200)) .force(\u0026#39;center\u0026#39;, d3.forceCenter(width / 2, height / 2)); Nodes repel each other (charge force) while links pull connected nodes together. The result is a layout where clusters naturally emerge.\nTwo Types of Edges The graph shows two kinds of connections:\nDirect links (solid blue): Explicit wikilinks between notes. These are intentional connections you create.\nTag connections (dashed gray): Notes sharing the same tag. These are implicit - they suggest possible relationships you might not have noticed.\nTechnical Detail: Edge Detection Direct links are detected by scanning note content for [[...]] patterns and wikilink shortcodes. This happens at build time, so the graph data is static and fast to load.\n{{- $bracketMatches := findRE `\\[\\[([^\\]|]+)` $content -}} Reading the Graph Clusters indicate related concepts. The [[Note-Taking]] and [[Learning]] nodes should be close together, connected by shared notes.\nHubs are highly-connected nodes. MOCs like [[Note-Taking]] naturally become hubs because they link to many notes.\nBridges connect different clusters. A note that links learning concepts to technical implementations bridges those domains.\nFiltering The full-page graph offers controls to:\nShow/hide sections (articles, notes, projects) Toggle direct links vs tag connections Search for specific notes Zoom in on details This makes large graphs manageable while preserving the overall structure.\nLimitations The graph is a model, not reality. It shows explicit connections but not the implicit understanding in your head.\nUse it as a tool for discovery, not a measure of knowledge completeness.\nBuilding Your Own The graph is generated entirely in Hugo templates.

Modern digital tools make the method even more powerful. ) Why Zettelkasten? Most note-taking systems fail because they\u0026rsquo;re designed for storage, not thinking. You capture information, file it away, and never see it again.\nThe Zettelkasten is different. It\u0026rsquo;s designed for:\nConnection: Every note links to others Emergence: Ideas combine in unexpected ways Growth: The system becomes more valuable over time Start Small You don\u0026rsquo;t need thousands of notes to benefit. Even 20-30 well-connected notes create useful emergence. Core Principles 1. Atomic Notes Each note should contain exactly one idea. See [[The Atomic Notes Principle]] for why this constraint is liberating, not limiting.\n2. Write for Your Future Self Don\u0026rsquo;t just copy quotes. Write in your own words, as if explaining to someone unfamiliar with the source. This forces understanding.\n3. Link Liberally Every note should link to at least one other note. These connections are where the magic happens. See [[Bidirectional Linking]] for how backlinks enable discovery.\nGetting Started Pick a tool: This site uses Hugo with wikilinks. Obsidian, Roam, and others work too. Start with what interests you: Don\u0026rsquo;t try to build a comprehensive system. Follow curiosity. Create your first MOC: A [[Note-Taking|Map of Content]] organizes related notes. Review regularly: [[Spaced Repetition]] keeps knowledge fresh. No Perfect System The best system is one you\u0026rsquo;ll actually use. Don\u0026rsquo;t over-engineer. Start writing, and evolve your approach over time. Common Mistakes Over-categorizing: Tags and folders are less important than links. 04 (sidenote: 04 Luhmann famously said his Zettelkasten was his \u0026ldquo;second brain\u0026rdquo; - not a filing cabinet. ) Collecting without processing: Capture is easy; thinking is hard.
