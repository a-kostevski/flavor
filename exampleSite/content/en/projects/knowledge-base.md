---

My personal knowledge base, built using the Flavor theme and Zettelkasten principles.

## Purpose

A second brain for:
- Capturing ideas and insights
- Connecting concepts across domains
- Writing and thinking in public
- Building a searchable personal wiki

## Structure

The knowledge base is organized around Maps of Content (MOCs):

- [[Note-Taking]] - Personal knowledge management
- [[Learning]] - Learning techniques and cognitive science

Individual notes link freely across these domains, creating a web of interconnected ideas.

## Workflow

1. **Capture**: Daily notes and fleeting thoughts
2. **Process**: Extract permanent notes from captures
3. **Connect**: Link new notes to existing knowledge
4. **Review**: Browse the graph for serendipitous discovery

## Evolution

The system grows organically. I don't pre-plan structure - it emerges from the connections between notes.

Currently focused on building density in the note-taking and learning domains before expanding to new areas.

## Tools

- **Hugo + Flavor**: Static site generation
- **VS Code**: Editing with markdown preview
- **Git**: Version control and backup
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting
