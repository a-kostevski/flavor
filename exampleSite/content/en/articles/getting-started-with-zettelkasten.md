The Zettelkasten ("slip box" in German) is a note-taking method that transforms how you think and write. Developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann, who used it to write over 70 books, the system creates a network of interconnected ideas.{{< sidenote >}}Luhmann maintained his Zettelkasten on paper index cards. Modern digital tools make the method even more powerful.{{< /sidenote >}}

## Why Zettelkasten?

Most note-taking systems fail because they're designed for *storage*, not *thinking*. You capture information, file it away, and never see it again.

The Zettelkasten is different. It's designed for:
- **Connection**: Every note links to others
- **Emergence**: Ideas combine in unexpected ways
- **Growth**: The system becomes more valuable over time

You don't need thousands of notes to benefit. Even 20-30 well-connected notes create useful emergence.

## Core Principles

### 1. Atomic Notes

Each note should contain exactly one idea. See [[The Atomic Notes Principle]] for why this constraint is liberating, not limiting.

### 2. Write for Your Future Self

Don't just copy quotes. Write in your own words, as if explaining to someone unfamiliar with the source. This forces understanding.

### 3. Link Liberally

Every note should link to at least one other note. These connections are where the magic happens. See [[Bidirectional Linking]] for how backlinks enable discovery.

## Getting Started

1. **Pick a tool**: This site uses Hugo with wikilinks. Obsidian, Roam, and others work too.
2. **Start with what interests you**: Don't try to build a comprehensive system. Follow curiosity.
3. **Create your first MOC**: A [[Note-Taking|Map of Content]] organizes related notes.
4. **Review regularly**: [[Spaced Repetition]] keeps knowledge fresh.

The best system is one you'll actually use. Don't over-engineer. Start writing, and evolve your approach over time.

## Common Mistakes

**Over-categorizing**: Tags and folders are less important than links.{{< sidenote >}}Luhmann famously said his Zettelkasten was his "second brain" - not a filing cabinet.{{< /sidenote >}}

**Collecting without processing**: Capture is easy; thinking is hard. See [[Progressive Summarization]] for a method to process notes over time.

**Expecting immediate results**: The value compounds. Give it time.
