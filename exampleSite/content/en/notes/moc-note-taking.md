This is a **Map of Content** organizing my notes about note-taking systems and personal knowledge management.

## Core Principles

The foundation of effective note-taking:

- [[The Atomic Notes Principle]] - One idea per note
- [[Evergreen Notes]] - Notes that grow over time
- [[Bidirectional Linking]] - Two-way connections between notes

## Techniques

Methods for processing and organizing knowledge:

- [[Progressive Summarization]] - Distilling notes over multiple passes
- [[Spaced Repetition]] - Reviewing at optimal intervals

## Sources and Inspiration

Where these ideas come from:

- [[How to Take Smart Notes]] - Sönke Ahrens on the Zettelkasten method
- [[As We May Think]] - Vannevar Bush's visionary 1945 essay

## Fleeting Thoughts

Ideas still being developed:

- [[Idea: Why Atomic Notes Work]]
- [[Thought: Links vs. Tags]]
