This note demonstrates the **orphan detection** feature.

No other note links to this page, so it appears on the [Orphan Notes](/orphans/) page.

## Why Orphan Detection Matters

In a Zettelkasten system, value comes from connections. An unlinked note:
- Cannot be discovered through browsing
- Doesn't contribute to the knowledge graph
- May be forgotten

The orphan detector surfaces these notes so you can decide to:
1. **Link them** to relevant notes
2. **Delete them** if no longer useful
3. **Develop them** into more complete thoughts

## This Note's Purpose

This specific note exists only to demonstrate the orphan detection feature. In a real system, you'd either integrate it or remove it.

Try visiting the [Orphan Notes page](/orphans/) to see this note listed there!
