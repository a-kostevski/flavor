Quick observation while organizing notes today:

**Tags** = "this note is *about* X"
**Links** = "this note *relates to* that specific note"

Tags create broad buckets. Links create specific bridges.

I've been over-using tags when I should be linking. A note about [[Spaced Repetition]] doesn't just need the tag "learning" - it needs a direct link to [[Progressive Summarization]] because they're related techniques.

The [[Note-Taking|knowledge graph]] shows this clearly: tags create dense clusters, links create meaningful paths between clusters.
