Just realized why [[The Atomic Notes Principle|atomic notes]] feel so right:

When I try to write about two ideas in one note, I get stuck. The note never feels complete. But when I split them, each note writes itself.

The constraint isn't limiting - it's *liberating*.

Maybe like how haiku's strict form produces better poetry than "write whatever you want"?
