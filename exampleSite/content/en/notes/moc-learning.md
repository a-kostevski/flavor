## My Learning Philosophy

Learning isn't about consuming information - it's about building connections. Each new concept should link to existing knowledge, strengthening both.

The [[Note-Taking|knowledge graph]] visualizes this: isolated facts float alone, while connected concepts form clusters of understanding.

The goal isn't to remember everything. It's to know where to find things and how they relate.
