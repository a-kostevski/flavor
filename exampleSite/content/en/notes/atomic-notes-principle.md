The atomic notes principle states that each note should contain exactly one idea. This constraint forces clarity and enables powerful connections.

## Why Atomicity Matters

When a note contains multiple ideas, linking becomes ambiguous. Does a link point to idea A or idea B? By keeping notes atomic, every link has a clear, unambiguous target.

Atomic notes are:
- **Self-contained**: Understandable without context
- **Linkable**: Can be connected precisely
- **Reusable**: Can appear in multiple contexts
- **Evolvable**: Can be refined independently

## The Test

Ask yourself: "Can I summarize this note in one sentence?" If you need multiple sentences covering different topics, the note should be split.

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Atomic notes enable [[Evergreen Notes]] by providing stable building blocks. They support [[Bidirectional Linking]] by creating clear link targets.

This principle comes from the original Zettelkasten method, as described in [[How to Take Smart Notes]].

## Implementation

In practice, aim for notes between 100-500 words. Long enough to develop the idea, short enough to stay focused. Use links liberally to connect to related concepts rather than cramming everything into one note.
