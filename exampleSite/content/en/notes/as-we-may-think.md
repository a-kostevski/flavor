---

In 1945, Vannevar Bush published "As We May Think" in The Atlantic, describing the *Memex* - a hypothetical device for storing and linking personal knowledge.

## The Memex Vision

Bush imagined a desk-sized device containing:
- Microfilm storage of all books and records
- A mechanism to add personal annotations
- The ability to create **trails** between related items

> "The human mind operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts."

The trail-making capability is remarkably similar to modern [[Bidirectional Linking]].

## Prescient Ideas

Bush anticipated:
- **Hypertext**: Linking between documents
- **Personal knowledge bases**: Individual collections of information
- **Associative retrieval**: Finding by connection, not location

He recognized that hierarchical organization (like library classification) doesn't match how we think.

## Historical Context

Written as WWII ended, Bush was reflecting on how scientific knowledge had exploded during the war. He worried about researchers drowning in publications, unable to find relevant prior work.

## Connection to Modern Systems

The Memex directly inspired:
- Ted Nelson's Xanadu project
- Douglas Engelbart's NLS
- The World Wide Web
- Modern PKM tools like Roam, Obsidian, and this [[Note-Taking|system]]

Bush's vision took 75 years to become practical. We now have the tools he imagined - the question is whether we use them effectively.

See [[How to Take Smart Notes]] for a practical methodology that fulfills Bush's vision.
