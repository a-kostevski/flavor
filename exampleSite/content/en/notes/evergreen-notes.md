Evergreen notes are notes designed to grow and improve over time. Unlike fleeting captures or project-specific documentation, evergreen notes are investments in your future thinking.

## Characteristics

**Concept-oriented**: Written about ideas, not sources or events. A note titled "Spaced Repetition" is evergreen; "Notes from Chapter 3" is not.

**Densely linked**: Connected to many other notes, forming a web of knowledge. Each new connection adds context and value.

**Written for yourself**: In your own words, reflecting your understanding. Not quotes or summaries, but synthesis.

## The Compound Effect

Like compound interest, evergreen notes become more valuable over time:

1. Each note you add creates potential connections
2. Each connection strengthens understanding
3. Stronger understanding leads to better notes
4. Better notes attract more connections

This creates a positive feedback loop where your knowledge base becomes increasingly useful.

## Maintenance

Evergreen notes require occasional tending:
- Update when your understanding evolves
- Add links as you discover connections
- Split when notes grow beyond [[The Atomic Notes Principle|atomic size]]
- Merge when notes overlap significantly
