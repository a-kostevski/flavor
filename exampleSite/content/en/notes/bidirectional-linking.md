Bidirectional linking means that when note A links to note B, note B automatically knows about and displays the connection back to A. This simple mechanism transforms how we navigate and discover knowledge.

## Why Backlinks Matter

Traditional links are one-way streets. You know where you're going, but you can't see where you came from. Backlinks complete the picture.

Consider a note about "Machine Learning". Without backlinks, you only see what ML links to. With backlinks, you discover:
- Projects that use ML
- Problems ML might solve
- Related concepts you've explored

This serendipitous discovery is impossible with one-way links.

## Enabling Discovery

Backlinks surface unexpected connections. When you create a note about a new concept and see it already has backlinks, you've discovered relationships you didn't consciously make.

This is the essence of networked thought: the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts.

## Implementation

In this system, backlinks appear automatically at the bottom of each note. They show:
- The linking note's title
- Context around the link
- A direct path to explore further

## Foundation for Graphs

Bidirectional links enable the [[Note-Taking|knowledge graph visualization]]. Each bidirectional link becomes an edge in the graph, making your knowledge structure visible and navigable.
