## Morning

Re-read [[As We May Think]]. Bush's 1945 vision is remarkably accurate. We have the tools he imagined - now it's about using them well.

## Afternoon

Added more links between notes. The [[Bidirectional Linking|backlinks]] section is becoming useful - I can see how ideas connect from both directions.

## Ideas

- Should create a note about "reading vs. thinking" - consuming information isn't the same as processing it
- The [[Learning|learning MOC]] needs more structure
