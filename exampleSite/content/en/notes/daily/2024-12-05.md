## Afternoon

Working on setting up this knowledge base. The [[Note-Taking|graph visualization]] is starting to look interesting now that I have some connected notes.

## Evening

Quick thought: the constraint of [[The Atomic Notes Principle|atomic notes]] feels similar to the constraint of daily notes. Both force focus.
