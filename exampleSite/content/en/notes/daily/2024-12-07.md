## Morning

Working on [[Evergreen Notes]]. The idea that notes compound in value over time is compelling. Like investments - small consistent additions lead to big results.

## Afternoon

Explored the full-page graph view today. Interesting to see clusters forming around [[Note-Taking]] and [[Learning]].

## Tasks Done

- [x] Link spaced repetition to progressive summarization
- [x] Add literature notes from Ahrens book
- [ ] Create note on retrieval practice
