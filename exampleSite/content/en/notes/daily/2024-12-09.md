## Morning

Wrote [[Thought: Links vs. Tags]] after yesterday's cleanup. The distinction is clearer now:
- Tags = broad categorization
- Links = specific relationships

## Afternoon

The knowledge base feels alive now. When I open a note, the backlinks show me connections I forgot I made. Exactly what [[How to Take Smart Notes|Ahrens]] describes.

## What's Working

- Daily notes as an entry point
- MOCs as navigation hubs
- The [[Note-Taking|graph]] for serendipitous discovery

## What Needs Work

- More permanent notes (too many fleeting ones)
- Better link density
- Regular review sessions
