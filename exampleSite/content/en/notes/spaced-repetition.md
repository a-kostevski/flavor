Spaced repetition is a learning technique based on the spacing effect: we remember things better when we review them at increasing intervals rather than cramming.

## The Science

When you learn something new, the memory decays over time. Each review strengthens the memory and slows the decay rate. By timing reviews just before you'd forget, you maximize retention with minimum effort.

The optimal intervals follow a pattern:
1. First review: 1 day
2. Second review: 3 days
3. Third review: 7 days
4. Fourth review: 14 days
5. And so on, roughly doubling each time

## Application to Note-Taking

Spaced repetition complements [[Evergreen Notes]] naturally. Each time you revisit a note to add links or refine content, you're reinforcing that knowledge.

The [[Note-Taking|knowledge graph]] can guide your reviews. Notes with many connections are naturally reviewed more often as you traverse the graph. Orphan notes might need deliberate scheduling.

## Tools and Systems

Dedicated SRS tools like Anki automate interval scheduling. But even without special software, the principle applies:
- Revisit notes periodically
- Use daily notes to reference older concepts
- Let curiosity guide exploratory sessions

## Connection to Writing

Writing itself is a form of retrieval practice. When you write about a concept in your own words, you're testing and strengthening your understanding.

See [[Progressive Summarization]] for a method that naturally incorporates spaced review.
