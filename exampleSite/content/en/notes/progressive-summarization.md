Progressive summarization is Tiago Forte's method for extracting value from notes over time. Instead of processing everything upfront, you distill notes progressively as you use them.

## The Layers

Each pass adds a layer of highlighting:

**Layer 0**: Original content (capture)
**Layer 1**: Bold the most interesting passages
**Layer 2**: Highlight the bolded passages that stand out
**Layer 3**: Write a brief summary at the top
**Layer 4**: Remix into your own original content

You don't apply all layers immediately. Each layer is added when you revisit the note for a specific purpose.

## Just-in-Time Processing

The key insight: don't process notes until you need them. Most captured content is never used. Progressive summarization ensures you only invest effort in notes that prove valuable.

This connects to [[Spaced Repetition]]: each revisit is an opportunity for both review and distillation.

## Relationship to Zettelkasten

Progressive summarization is compatible with the [[The Atomic Notes Principle|atomic notes principle]]. As you distill a note to its essence, you might extract multiple atomic notes from the highlights.

It bridges the gap between quick capture and [[Evergreen Notes]]:
1. Capture quickly (fleeting notes)
2. Progressively distill over time
3. Extract permanent atomic notes when insights crystallize

## Practical Application

Start with Layer 1 on everything you capture. Add deeper layers only when you return to a note. Let future you decide what's truly valuable.

See [[How to Take Smart Notes]] for the original Zettelkasten approach that influenced this method.
